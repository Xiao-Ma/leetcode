 * LeetCode: count of range sum
 * Description: Given an integer array nums, return the number of range sums 
 *              that lie in [lower, upper] inclusive. Range sum S(i, j) is 
 *              defined as the sum of the elements in nums between indices i and
 *              j (i â‰¤ j), inclusive.
 * Note: A naive algorithm of O(n^2) is trivial. You MUST do better than that.
