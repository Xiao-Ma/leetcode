 * LeetCode: Kth Smallest Element in a BST
 * Description: Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find
 *              the kth smallest element in it. You may assume k is always 
 *              valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ BST's total elements. What if the BST is modified
 *              (insert/delete operations) often and you need to find the kth 
 *              smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest 
 *              routine?
 * Idea: binary search
