 * LeetCode: Range Sum Query - Immutable
 * Description: Given an integer array nums, find the sum of the elements 
 *              between indices i and j (i â‰¤ j), inclusive.
 *              You may assume that the array does not change.
 *              There are many calls to sumRange function.
 * Idea: See that the sumRange function will be called many times, if want to 
 *       save time, we can store all results, so each call will take O(1) time.
 *       A first thought is to pre-calculate all sumRange(i, j) and store them,
 *       that will take O(n^2) space.
 *       A better way is to store the cumulated sum in O(n), and get the range 
 *       by a minus operation.
 *       Here we have the thought of "cache".
